| **Decoding of the Abbreviation** | **The Translation for the Royal Court** |
| --- | --- |
| **Reason For Champagne** | "Sire, the drawbridge is down, the banners are flying. Sign this parchment so we may crack the casks of the finest vintage and feast until dawn." |
| **Request For Confirmation** | "My Liege, pray cast your eye upon these blueprints one last time. Merely nod to confirm that, yes, you strictly desire the moat to be filled with alligators, not crocodiles." |
| **Ready For Commissioning** | "The catapult is built, the tension is set. We await only your Royal Wave to fling a test pumpkin into the neighboring duchy." |
| **Request For Capital** | "A fortress is built on stone, but fueled by gold. The masons have stopped working and are looking at me with hungry eyes. Open the treasury, or the wall stays down." |
| **Request For Commitment** | "We require more than your blessing, Sire. We require your armies. Pledge your knights to haul timber for the next fortnight, or this tower shall never rise." |
| **Request For Consent** | "I dare not lay a single brick without your explicit blessing, Your Grace. Give us the Royal Nod so we may proceed without fear of the headsman." |
| **Request For Clearance** | "The peasants are currently holding a market in the exact spot where the new murder-holes are to be drilled. Kindly order them to disperse so we may work." |
| **Ready For Closure** | "I have not slept in three moons. I beg of thee, affix your seal to this document so I may retire to my chambers and weep in peace." |
| **Request For Closure** | "The Council of Elders has argued about the shade of the tapestries for six months. Enough. Sign this to end the bickering, lest I throw myself from the parapets." |
| **Release From Chains** | "Signing this scroll signifies that the Keep is finished, and I am finally released from my indentured servitude to this accursed construction project." |
| **Really Final Call** | "Hear ye, hear ye! If any Lord or Lady has an objection to the gargoyles, speak now. Once the sun sets, the gargoyles are set in stone. Literally." |
| **Regulation For Control** | "The Royal Auditor has arrived with his abacus. This document ensures we are tracking every nail, lest we be accused of embezzling iron." |
| **Requirement For Compliance** | "These are the King’s rules. They are not suggestions. You will build the wall ten feet high, or you will explain to the King why his enemies are in his bedroom." |
| **Rule For Compliance** | "It is written in the Ancient Laws of Zoning. Sign here to acknowledge that you have been warned: no wooden roofs in the dragon zone." |
| **Refusal For Changes** | "I have barred the door to the drafting room. The ink is dry. Suggesting a new window placement now will result in immediate defenestration." |
| **Requirement For Conformity** | "We are building a castle, not a circus. Resistance is futile. All towers must look exactly like the King’s tower. Assimilate or be exiled." |
| **Roadmap For Control** | "Look at me. I am the Castle Steward now. Sign this to acknowledge the new hierarchy, lest you find your quarters moved to the stables." |
| **Request For Capitulation** | "You have fought valiantly against the installation of the indoor plumbing, but you have lost. Surrender your dignity, sign the paper, and let us lay the pipes." |
| **Request For Cover** | "I require the King’s own signature on this risky endeavor. Thus, when the peasants revolt over the new taxes, I can point to this scroll and say, 'I was merely following orders.'" |
| **Record Of Complicity** | "We are all in this sinking ship together, my Lords. Sign here to create a permanent record that you, too, thought building a castle on a swamp was a brilliant idea." |
| **Receipt For Culpability** | "By affixing your seal, you acknowledge that when the spire inevitably collapses due to the budget cuts you demanded, it is officially, historically, and legally Your Fault." |
