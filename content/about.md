# Who am I?
I am Andrey Kumanyaev: father, husband, an author, speaker...

I work for [Vio.com](https://www.vio.com/), a rapidly growing, independent hotel booking marketplace and meta-search platform, as a Senior Engineering Manager, working with several genius teams and responsible for high-load business-critial services. 

Previously, as CTO of Pact (B2B SaaS), I led development from inception to market, and at MyDreams, I rebuilt a failing social platform into a scalable, user-focused product.

I started my carreer in 2007 and I'm passionate about building reliable, scalable, high-load platforms that power innovative solutions. For over {{< years_since 2007 >}} years, I have navigated the intersection of code, culture, and strategy—transitioning from hands-on building to leading high-performance engineering organizations.

My background is rooted in the "Player-Coach" mentality: I believe effective technical leadership requires maintaining fluency in the tools my teams use.

My technical expertise spans Golang, Rust, Ruby, Elixir, Erlang, and Python. I'm comfortable working with AWS and on-premises setups. I thrive on mentoring high-performance teams, optimizing processes, and driving innovation in fast-paced environments.

# What is this Site?

I started zzet.org as a place to keep my own writings, initially just articles I'd written for other purposes.

I didn't want to use third-party services because of a bad experience with frequent design changes that worsened the articles' formatting. I like the control I have to publish what I like, to control its format, and to evolve it as needed. Some time ago it made a bad joke due to which I've lost a part of the articles, and I've migrated to hosting the website using Git. Some articles I recovered and you can find them in the [Archive](/archive)

I didn't write to the blog for a long time due to relocation and lack of time.

## To learn about new posts
I post new material regularly to this site, and have a number of feeds that I use to let people know when this happens.

I also post about new material on several social media channels: LinkedIn, and X (Twitter). Twitter used to be my primary place to post these updates, but it's declined in value considerably over the couple of years.

# Speaking
I was a regular speaker at many international conferences on software development.
I retired from speaking during the relocation period.
